        <h1>Indus Valley Civilization:</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="one"><span>The Indus Valley Civilization</span>, also known as the <b><q><mark><a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Indus_Valley_Civilization/">Indus-Sarasvati Civilization or Harappan Civilization</a></mark> </q></b>, was a prominent cultural and political entity that thrived in the northern region of the Indian subcontinent between approximately 7000 and 600 BCE, taking its name from its location in the Indus River valley.</p>

    <p class="two">These alternative names stem from the <b><mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasvati_River">Sarasvati River</a></mark></b>, referenced in Vedic texts, which once flowed alongside the<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_River"  > Indus River</a></mark>, and the ancient <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harappa">  city of Harappa</a></mark>  , the first major site of the civilization discovered in the modern era. None of these names are drawn from ancient writings, as scholars, while believing that the people of this civilization created a writing system (called the<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_script" > Indus Script or Harappan Script</a></mark> ), have not yet been able to decipher it.</p>
    <p class="ab">All three designations are modern constructs, and the origin, development, decline, and fall of the civilization remain largely unknown. However, modern archaeology has helped establish a likely chronology and periodization for the Indus Valley Civilization.</p>
    <p class="city">The Indus Valley Civilization is now often compared with the far more famous cultures of<mark> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"> Egypt</a></mark> and <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia#:~:text=Mesopota" > Mesopotamia</a></mark>, but this is a fairly recent development. The discovery of Harappa in 1829 CE was the first indication that any such civilization existed in India, and by that time, Egyptian hieroglyphics had been deciphered, Egyptian and Mesopotamian sites excavated, and cuneiform would soon be translated by the scholar<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Smith_(Assyriologist)" > George Smith (l. 1840-1876 CE).</a> </mark>   Archaeological excavations of the Indus Valley Civilization, therefore, had a significantly late start comparatively, and it is now thought that many of the accomplishments and “firsts” attributed to Egypt and Mesopotamia may actually belong to the people of the Indus Valley Civilization.</p>
    <p class="oreo">The two best-known excavated cities of this culture are <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harappa">Harappa</a></mark> and<mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohenjo-daro">   Mohenjo-daro</mark>  </a>  (located in modern-day Pakistan), both of which are thought to have once had populations of between 40,000-50,000 people, which is stunning when one realizes that most ancient cities had on average 10,000 people living in them. The total population of the civilization is thought to have been upward of 5 million, and its territory stretched over 900 miles (1,500 km) along the banks of the Indus River and then in all directions outward. Indus Valley Civilization sites have been found near the border of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal"> <mark>  Nepal</mark>  </a>, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan"> <mark>   Afghanistan</mark>  </a>  , on the <mark>  coasts of India, and around Delhi, </mark>  to name only a few locations.</p>
    <p class="red">Why the Indus Valley Civilization declined and fell is unknown, but scholars believe it may have had to do with climate change, the drying up of the Sarasvati River, an alteration in the path of the monsoon which watered crops, overpopulation of the cities, a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia, or a combination of any of the above. In the present day, excavations continue at many of the sites found thus far and some future find may provide more information on the history and decline of the culture.</p>
     
    <h2>Harappa & Mohenjo-daro:</h2>
    <p class="first"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_texts" >  <mark>  The Hindu texts</mark>   </a>known as the Vedas, as well as other great works of Indian tradition such as the<mark>   Mahabharata and Ramayana</mark>  , were already well known to Western scholars but they did not know what culture had created them. Systemic racism of the time prevented them from attributing the works to the people of India, and the same, at first, led archaeologists to conclude that Harappa was a colony of the Sumerians of Mesopotamia or perhaps an Egyptian outpost.</p>
    <figure class="v">

    <p class="harappa">Harappa did not conform to either Egyptian or Mesopotamian architecture, however, as there was no evidence of temples, palaces, or monumental structures, no names of kings or queens or stelae or royal statuary. The city spread over <mark>  370 acres (150 hectares) </mark>  of small, brick houses with flat roofs made of clay. There was a citadel, walls, the streets were laid out in a grid pattern clearly demonstrating a high degree of skill in urban planning and, in comparing the two sites, it was apparent to the excavators that they were dealing with a highly advanced culture.</p>
    <p class="xyz">Houses in both cities had flush toilets, a sewer system, and fixtures on either side of the streets were part of an elaborate drainage system, which was more advanced even than that of the early Romans. Devices known from Persia as “wind catchers” were attached to the roofs of some buildings which provided air conditioning for the home or administrative office and, at Mohenjo-daro, there was a great public bath, surrounded by a courtyard, with steps leading down into it.

        As other sites were unearthed, the same degree of sophistication and skill came to light as well as the understanding that all of these cities had been pre-planned. Unlike those of other cultures which usually developed from smaller, rural communities, the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization had been thought out, a site chosen, and purposefully constructed prior to full habitation. Further, they all exhibited conformity to a single vision which further suggested a strong central government with an efficient bureaucracy that could plan, fund, and build such cities. Scholar John Keay comments:</p> 
    <p class="Mohenjo-daro">Excavations at both sites continued between 1944-1948 CE under the direction of the British archaeologist<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_Wheeler" > <mark>    Sir Mortimer Wheeler</mark>  </a>  (l. 1890-1976 CE) whose racialist ideology made it difficult for him to accept that dark-skinned people had built the cities. Even so, he managed to establish stratigraphy for Harappa and lay the foundation for the later periodization of the Indus Valley Civilization.</p>

    <p id="a123">Just as there is no definitive answer to the question of what the seals were, what the “unicorn” represented, or how the people venerated their gods, there is none for why the culture declined and fell.<mark>   Between c. 1900 - c. 1500 BCE</mark>  , the cities were steadily abandoned, and the people moved south. As noted, there are a number of theories concerning this, but none are completely satisfactory. According to one, <mark>  the Gaggar-Hakra River</mark>  , which is identified with the <mark>  Sarasvati River </mark>  from Vedic texts, and which ran adjacent to the Indus River, dried up <mark>    1900 BCE</mark>  , necessitating a major relocation of the people who had depended on it. Significant silting at sites such as Mohenjo-daro suggests major flooding which is given as another cause.</p>
  
    <p id="a765">As excavations of the sites of the Indus Valley Civilization continue, more information will no doubt contribute to a better understanding of its history and development. Recognition of the culture's vast accomplishments and high level of technology and sophistication has been increasingly coming to light and gaining greater attention. Scholar  <mark>    Jeffrey D.</mark>   Long expresses the general sentiment, writing, “there is much fascination with this civilization because of its high level of technological advancement” . Already, the Indus Valley Civilization is referenced as one of the three greatest of antiquity alongside Egypt and Mesopotamia, and future excavations will almost surely elevate its standing even higher.</p>
